Rest API and Database creation in json format
First i created database with student,HOD and Department in sqlite which contain 5 students with their departments and HOD.
Then i linked the database with pycharm and created file named rest.py and called the file in json format and listed the data. I got the output of the database that i have created in pycharm terminal.Then i installed flask in pycharm and then created a new file called app.py and done the rest API operations
ie CRUD(create,read,update,delete) operations.For this i have installed postman and first i have done 'get' operation and i have got the whole data in the postman terminal and then 'post' operation by adding extra data,then in 'put' operation i have updated the result and finally in 'delete' operation i have deleted data.So here i have uploaded 4 files app.py for rest api operation and rest.py for json format calling data and the other two is sql file which contain the database and the table that i have used for this programs.
